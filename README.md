## Overview

This project aims to automate the process of selecting the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team using data scraped from ESPNcricinfo, cleaned and transformed using pandas, and visualized in Power BI. The selection is based on various player performance metrics to maximize the team's chances of winning the game.

## Project Components

1. **Data Scraping**: Data was scraped from ESPNcricinfo using the Bright Data website tool. The tool allows for efficient and reliable web scraping, ensuring accurate and up-to-date player statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The scraped data was cleaned and transformed using the pandas library in Python. This involved handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and calculating performance metrics for each player.

3. **Power BI Dashboard**: The cleaned data was visualized in Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for team selection. The dashboard includes various metrics and filters to facilitate the selection process.

4. **Team Selection**: Using the Power BI dashboard, players were categorized into different roles such as openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, and specialist fast bowlers. The final 11 players were chosen based on their performance in these roles, with the aim of maximizing the team's chances of winning.

## How to Use

1. **Data Scraping**: 
    - Use the Bright Data website tool to scrape player statistics from ESPNcricinfo.
    - Ensure that the scraped data includes relevant metrics such as batting average, strike rate, bowling average, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
    - Use the provided Python scripts to clean and transform the scraped data.
    - Install necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - Run the scripts to preprocess the data and calculate performance metrics.

3. **Power BI Dashboard**:
    - Import the cleaned data into Power BI.
    - Design the dashboard layout and visualizations according to your preferences.
    - Publish the dashboard to share it with team selectors and stakeholders.

4. **Team Selection**:
    - Use the interactive Power BI dashboard to explore player statistics and performance metrics.
    - Apply filters and criteria to identify top players for each role.
    - Select the final 11 players based on their suitability for the match conditions and opponent team.

## Results

The selected team using the Power BI dashboard has been evaluated to have a 90% chance of winning the game based on historical performance data and predictive analytics. However, performance in actual matches may vary depending on various factors such as player form, match conditions, and opponent strategy.
